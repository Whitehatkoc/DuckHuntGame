# DuckHuntGameInJavaFX

In the last assignment of the spring 2023 semester of my department, I coded a 6-level duck shooting game in javaFX. You can review the pdf of the assignment named BBM104_S23_PA4_v1 prepared by my teachers.

Please compil at src/ 

to COMPILE: javac DuckHunt.java 

to RUN: java DuckHunt

You can see a file named assets in the src file. This file contains files such as background, bird images, foreground, crosshair, effects, music etc. If you do not want to make any changes to these files, leave the assets file as it is.
If you want to make changes, do not change the file names, just change the contents. And the assets file should definitely be inside the src

There are variables named VOLUME and SCALE in the code. You can change these variables as you want. Ä±f you change the scale and volume value and you have trouble compiling, compile with the command javac *.java

Before starting the game, background and crosshair selection are made by using arrow keys.
The difficulty of the game increases by changing the number of birds or their movements in each level.
Gamer has 3 times the number of rounds of birds, that is, the right to hit.

Enjoy the game
